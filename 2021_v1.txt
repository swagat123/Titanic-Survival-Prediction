3) Career: 

I have gained good design, architecting and hands-on development skills of AI and Data Sciences solutions 
through continuous self training, hands-on project work, continuous development and certifications/advanced 
courses. I want to continue in the same path and be a top class AI/DS professional. I intend to lead and 
manage large AI/DS assignments as well as work on thought leadership in this area. I have been hands-on
in all my assignments and clearly intend to remain hands-on.

4) Money:

My salary is quite less compared to my 18 years of experience as well as compared to my peers in Capgemini
as well in other organizations. I expert a YoY increment of 20% for next 3-5 years to be at least at par.

5) Promotion:
