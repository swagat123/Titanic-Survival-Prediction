Use Case: Smart Energy Consumption for Sustainable Production
Summary:
In energy intensive industries like Iron and Steel, aluminum, cement, fertilizer, refining, and pulp and paper etc., energy constitutes a major portion of input cost. Energy constitutes a significant portion of the cost of steel production, from 20% to 40%. Thus, improvements in energy efficiency and reduction in energy wastage result in reduced production costs and thereby improved competitiveness.
While in a regular production setting, the average energy consumption remains steady but power outages, machine breakdowns and other operational downtimes contributes hugely to energy wastage. Different downtimes force the production schedule to be ramped up to meet the production target thereby consuming more power at peak rates. In addition to this, a non-smoothened production scheduling also results in more peak-rate power consumption.
Industrial customers can pay immense rates for peak power.
Proposition
AI and machine-learning algorithms-based analytics and optimizations help businesses take the necessary corrective actions to minimize any peak demand charges and avoid peak time energy costs. Also, it will streamline a sustainable production process.
Solution
1.	Perform exploratory data analysis for past 2-3 years (i) energy consumption, both process level and aggregated level (ii) plant availability and downtime (iii) planned and actual production scheduling 
2.	Identify, develop and analyze using AI/ML algorithms and Neural Networks for past 2-3 years energy-related Key Performance Indicators (e-KPIs) in order to (i) identify firm-specific energy drivers in their production system, (ii) make the energy behavior profile of the production system transparent, (iii) recognize cause-effect-relationships, (iv) prepare actions for improvement measures.
3.	Advanced Energy Forecasting algorithms will give accurate power consumption predictions based on historical data analysis and short-term production planning horizon. Using an AI/ML algorithm, we can identify patterns in load profiles and also factors in seasonal trends and historical data. In so doing, the system can provide a daily/weekly/monthly energy consumption forecast for a particular production process or the whole shop floor.
4.	Production Schedule corrections and revised planned shutdown scheduling based on optimized energy forecasts.

Use Case: Anomaly-based network intrusion detection using artificial intelligence
Summary:
Anomaly-based network intrusion detection has become an indispensable player on the existing cybersecurity landscape, where it enables the identification of suspicious behaviors that significantly differ from normal activities. Network anomaly detection is crucial for securing a network or a host. It allows for timely mitigation when anomalous traffic instances appear. A network anomaly detection system captures and analyzes traffic and reports alarms when an anomaly is detected and updates profiles of normal as well as attack instances.

Proposition
An anomaly-based network intrusion detection system (ANIDS) is a system for detecting network anomalies by monitoring network traffic and classifying them as either normal or anomalous. The classification may be based on heuristics or may look for patterns or signatures, attempting to detect anomalies that are not found in normal system operation. An ANIDS should ideally be able to detect known as well as unknown attacks without any prior knowledge.
Solution
A hybrid ANIDS combines both supervised and unsupervised approaches of network anomaly detection. Such approaches can detect known as well as unknown attacks. One type of hybrid approach attempts to identify known attacks based on a supervised model with reference to a set of sample training data using an appropriate matching mechanism. The test instances that neither belong to normal nor any of the known attack instances are handled by the unsupervised model for the identification of new normal or novel intrusions.
